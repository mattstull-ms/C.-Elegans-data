This shiny app uses the caret package to generate regression models, evaluate them, and make predictions. 
The R code for the app can be found in the appropriate .ui and .server files.It can be run by simply downloading the app folder and typing runApp('path/to/dir/QC-App-2.0') in the R console. 
While slower, you may also utilize it at this url : https://matt-stull.shinyapps.io/qc-app-2/
Use the QC and sequencing data to get started modeling.
The interactive graph is a draft for presenting upstream QC data to customers so that they can see quality and quantity data and easily identify samples to redo.
