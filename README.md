# C.-Elegans-data
This shiny app uses the caret package (as well as packages for some of the wrapped machine learning tools) to generate regression models, evaluate them, and make predictions. This also includes packages such as rhandsontable for visualizing data.
The R code for the app can be found in the appropriate .ui and .server files. It can be run by simply downloading the app folder and typing runApp('path/to/dir/QC-App-2.0') in the R console. 
While slower, you may also utilize it at this url : https://matt-stull.shinyapps.io/qc-app-2/
Use the QC and sequencing data to get started modeling.
The interactive graph 2.0 and interactive graph apps use rflot and flot to present upstream QC data to customers so that they can see quality and quantity data and easily identify samples to redo.
